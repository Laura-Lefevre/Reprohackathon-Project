# This .gitignore file excludes all files that are automatically generated
# during the execution of the workflow. It keeps the repository clean by
# ignoring Snakemake working directories, pipeline outputs, large sequencing
# data files, R temporary files, and general temporary folders. Only the
# code and configuration needed to reproduce the pipeline are kept under version control.
